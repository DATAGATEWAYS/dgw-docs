## Origins in a Web3-native Builder Coop

**DATA GATEWAYS** spun out of [RaidGuild](https://www.raidguild.org/) â€” a decentralized collective of Web3 mercenaries: designers, developers, and strategists building digital infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem. RaidGuild functions as a service DAO, drawing on guild-based lore to structure workstreams and coordinate talent across a diverse network of contributors. When we realized that we believe in meaningful products rather than building for others, it was the moment this venture builder was born.

## From Projects to Protocols

Our founding team met while collaborating on client projects ranging from dApps to DAO tooling inside RaidGuild. These experiences instilled a shared commitment to open-source values, decentralised coordination, and user-first infrastructure.

## Community DNA

Working with and inside a builder cooperative shaped how we build. We value:

- **Build in Public**
- **Build Open-Source Software**
- **Practical experimentation before rigid processes** 

This grounding in community-based development continues to inform our venture builder today.
