## tl;dr

We‚Äôre building an AI-powered WhatsApp (and Telegram) bot to onboard crypto newcomers with instant answers and fill their knowledge gaps, while giving partners real-time insights (e.g., trending queries) to refine their growth roadmaps. Short-term, we‚Äôll launch crypto/fiat payments and a premium concierge upsell. By 2026, we target 1,000+ monthly users, then expand to crypto-native platforms to drive downstream value in emerging markets. Funding this unlocks transaction growth, ecosystem insights, and exposure for your offerings.

## The Problem

Most Web3 projects struggle to find users, but do not meet users where they are. There is currently no interactive onboarding and crypto-engagement tool utilising WhatsApp, which is the No. 1 messaging app in emerging markets.

* Users have a lack of unbiased, judgement-free source of truth for entering the web3 world  
* Project struggle to engage with users and to build communities  
* Projects lack real-time data on user pain points (e.g., *‚ÄúWhy are users in Nigeria churning?‚Äù*).  
* Users have to trust an unfamiliar and overwhelming array of wallets, exchanges, and protocols with inconsistent UX

## The Solution

A cross-platform WhatsApp-focused bot that:

**Guides Users**: AI answers FAQs (e.g., wallet setup) \+ human coaching upsell (pay per session).  
**Empowers Partners**: Dashboard with trends like:

* ‚ÄúTop queries in Southeast Asia this week.‚Äù  
* ‚ÄúSurge in NFT storage questions ‚Üí partner with a wallet.‚Äù  
* Builds local communities, educates users, and generates real engagement
